Signal interface in JLisp
=========================

handlers for all of the UNIX signals may be installed
(modulo any system restrictions)

(install-signal-handler signo thunk)

signo is the signal number, most of the common names
are defined (SIGHUP, SIGINT, ...)

where thunk is a procedure (lambda, macro, ccode) requiring
no arguments or may be:

	(), SIG_IGN	to ignore the signal
	#t, SIG_DFL	use the system default handler
