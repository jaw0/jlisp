Hooks in JLisp
==============


as in emacs, we have hooks which will be run at
particular times

to add hooks:

	(add-hook 'foo-hooks thunk)

where thunk is a procedure requiring 0 arguments

and we run them by:

	(run-hooks 'foo-hooks)


The internals will use:

	quit-hooks
	before-gc-hooks
	after-gc-hooks
