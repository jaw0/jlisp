README file for jlisp
=====================

jlisp is a lisp interpreter. It is heavily influenced from
the suchlikes of scheme, emacs-lisp, ...

It was designed to be easily used as an embedded interpreter
(which is what is was actually developed for)
It is easily extended.

blah, blah, blah (see the Describble file for more)

To build:
========

I have compiled this under SunOS and NetBSD, but there
ought be no trouble on elsewhats.

look at the file src/jlconf.h, adjust if need be.
edit the top level Makefile as appropriate
type:
	make
	make install

try it out, type:
	./jl
send in a bug report to the author:
	jaw@op.net


depending on your OS, you may get an error informing
you of a problem with re_comp and re_exec, if this is
the case, you have 3 choices:

	get the GNU regex.c and regex.h and uncomment the
	REGEX line in src/MAKEFILE
or
	define the flag NO_REGEXPS in jlconf.h to compile
	without regular expression support
or
	write your own re_comp and re_exec


also, depending on your OS, your sed may complain about
"Output line too long" while creating the help file,
you may ignore these (but be aware that the help file may
be incomplete)
